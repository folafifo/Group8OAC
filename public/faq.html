        <h1><b>FAQs</b></h1>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 5%;"><b>What is the Open Access Checker for?</b></h3>
            <p>The Open Access Checker is provided to authors to support them in finding Open-Access compliant routes through which to 
                    publish their articles. The tool allows an author to enter their funder and institution, along with a bibliography 
                    of journals, and checks if these combinations of funder, institution and journal offer any route 
                    to Open-Access compliance.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 3%;"><b>What file formats can I upload my bibliography in?</b></h3>
            <p>The Open-Access checker accepts only BibTeX file uploads, however, it also offers the option 
                    to upload a BibTeX formatted text submission.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 3%;"><b>I can't find my publication via its ISBN</b></h3>
            <p>The Open Access Checker only supports checks on serials that are identified by ISSN. If a book or conference series 
                    has an ISSN you can try searching with that, however, if it does not, you will not be able to determine your 
                    Open-Access compliance via this tool.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 3%;"><b>What is a Transformative Journal?</b></h3>
            <p>A Transformative Journal is a subscription/hybrid journal that is committed to transitioning to a fully OA journal. 
                In addition, it must:
                <ul>
                    <li>gradually increase the share of OA content and</li>
                    <li>offset subscription income from payments for publishing services (to avoid double payments).</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 3%;"><b>What is a Transformative Agreement?</b></h3>
            <p>The global <a href="https://oa2020.org/">Open Access 2020 Initiative (OA2020)</a> aims to accelerate the transition to 
                    Open Access by adopting strategies to systematically withdraw financial support of paywalled publishing venues and 
                    reinvest those funds to support Open Access publishing.</p>
            <p>Publishers are encouraged to enter into transformative arrangements globally in all countries and share data from 
                    such arrangements. These agreements are essentially a promise that the publishers will push toward 
                    transformative journals, and eventually full open-access publishing.</p>
